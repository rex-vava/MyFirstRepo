Brief Introduction About Myself

My name is Valentin Igiraneza, a Computer Science student and passionate Debate Coach from Rwanda with a strong interest in technology, education, and community engagement. I graduated from Kiziguro Secondary School with a background in mathematics, physics, and computer science, and I am currently advancing my studies while actively contributing to youth development and digital literacy.

Beyond academics, I bring experience in teaching, mentoring, and event coordination, having coached debate teams through iDebate Rwanda and supported large-scale events like the Dreamers Academy Debate Camp. My journey blends technical skills in computer science with leadership, communication, and problem-solving abilities, making me both adaptable and committed to creating meaningful impact in education, technology, and beyond.
